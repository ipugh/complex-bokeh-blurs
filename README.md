Circular Convolution

The goal of this project is to demonstrate circular convolution as a blur to emulate a bokeh-like blur

The only currently supported file format is a plain .ppm file (magic number P3)

The command line arguments are as follows
./executable input_file output_file blur_type

blur_type - contains a variable number of arguments based on the blur created
